2) Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Pulling changes mnually allows you to control what gets pulled and what doesn't. 
Maybe you are experimenting in one of the remote repositories and don't want to sync with all your repositories. In such a case,
automatic pulls would mess up your plans.
